    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Classifier (DT)**\n",
    "1. Real World Application\n",
    "  - Predicting which books in a library are high usage. \n",
    "  - Ref: Silverstein, C. and Shieber, S. M. Predicting individual book use for off-site storage using decision trees. Lib. Q. 66(3):266–293, 1996.\n",
    "2. Model Strengths\n",
    "  - Implicit feature selection. Because DTs split the data based on maximum information gain, the features that provide maximum information gain, i.e. the most important features of the dataset can be identified simply by looking at the highest nodes of the decision tree.\n",
    "  - Easy to explain underlying model to stakeholders.\n",
    "  - Constructing a decision tree and using it for predictions is fast. So lesser computational resources are needed.\n",
    "  - Does not require linearity of data\n",
    "3. Model Weaknesses\n",
    "  - DTs can perform excellently at the top nodes, but are prone to overfitting at the bottom. So pruning is necessary to ensure the model generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "  - Constructing an optimal decision tree seems to be an NP-complete problem. Hence, a greedy algorithm is used which tends to make locally-optimum decisions at each node. This is why a decision tree that is best for all the data is difficult to produce.\n",
    "4. Why is this a good candidate?   \n",
    "The major advantage is that less resources would be required as this is a very fast algorithm. Also, very little preprocessing is required to get good results. Finally, this model is easy to visualize and explain. When talking with the stakeholders of Charity ML, we would be able to explain how the different features in the dataset can explain whether a particular individual makes more than $50,000 annually.\n",

    "2. Model Strengths\n",
    " - Needs only a few datapoints, i.e. the support vectors to establish a decision boundary.\n",
    " - Does not require data to be linearly separable. Using the kernel trick, we can transform the data to a higher dimension feature space and find a hyperplane that separates the data.\n",
    " - SVM is a convex optimization problem. Hence it is possible to find a globally optimal solution, as no local optima exist.\n",
    "3. Model Weaknesses\n",
    " - Increased computation time, high algorithmic complexity and greater memory requirement.\n",
    " - Choosing the perfect kernel for the dataset is difficult.\n",
    " - Lack of transparency of results. It is difficult to explain how the model arrives at the results, given the complexity of the algorithm.\n",
    "4. Why is this a good candidate?  \n",
    "SVMs have very good generalization performance and can yield better results on test data. Unlike Neural Networks, they provide a unique solution. This provides confidence that the results are repeatable. If data turns out to be non linearly separable, this would be a good choice. Because it is maximum margin classifier, we can expect a reasonably good hyperplane to be produced.\n",

    "2. Model Strengths\n",
    "  - Less parameter tuning is needed.\n",
    "  - Error on test data continues to decrease as more and more training examples are added. Adaboost itself is robust to overfitting. Hence, generalizes extremely well to new data.\n",
    "  - Can come up with a much more complex decision boundary for the entire dataset compared to individual algorithms.\n",
    "  - Can be used with any weak learner, no prior knowledge needed about weak learner.\n",
    "  - Focus on classifying the 'hard' data points correctly.\n",
    "3. Model Weaknesses\n",
    " - Adaboost can fail if weak learners are too complex (i.e. they overfit the data).\n",
    " - Can overfit in the presence of noise (i.e. will assume noise to be trends in data).\n",
    "4. Why is this a good candidate?  \n",
    "It's very simple to implement, yet gives the benefit of having a complex decision boundary. Boosting seems to be the algorithm of choice in many real world applications."

    "\n",
    "For a non-profit, keeping budget constraints in mind, it would be ideal to find a model that is effective, yet minimizes computation costs. In our preliminary analysis, we find a **Decision Tree** to be the most appropriate model for this purpose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree is the fastest performing algorithm among the models we tested. This may not be as clear from the graphs because of the SVC skewing the graph towards it, but if we look at the actual numbers, the Adaboost does take nearly four times as long to train and predict. I would speak with the board of Charity ML whether they prefer the lower cost of the Decision Tree or the potentially superior performance of the Adaboost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the accuracy and F-Score of the Decision Tree at this stage appears to be lower than AdaBoost and SVC, it is clear that the Decision Tree is overfitting with the default parameters (evident by its jaw-dropping F-score on the training set, but low F-score when run on unseen data). We expect a significant improvement in accuracy with parameter tuning, without any increase in computation costs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the decision tree model is advantageous to the charity organization as it provides a simple mechansim to visualize the most important factors leading to donor contributions. Generally, non-profits have a lot of work accomplished by a large, diverse group of volunteers with differing backgrounds and levels of technical expertise. A model that can easily be conceptualized will lead to greater volunteer buy-in. Hence, we could expect greater engagement when it comes to, for example, collecting more data -- as they would be able to understand how a particular feature helps predict outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the slightly lower accuracy and F-score of the Decision Tree model will be more than compensated by reduced computation costs, and simplicity of implementation and results visualization."

    "A decison tree begins by analyzing the dataset and finding out which features provide the most information about whether a donor is likely to make a contribution. Once the most important feature is found, the tree splits the dataset into buckets based on the value of the datapoint for the most important feature. At this point, one of the buckets is likely to have a greater proportion of individuals with income over \\$50,000.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The tree now looks at the buckets and finds out which of the remaining features is most indicative of an individual's income being over \\$50,000. If it is possible to create a better distribution of donors and non-donors using this feature for a particular bucket, then the bucket is split into sub-bucket(s). The process continues until we're able to confidently predict whether an individual in a particular bucket makes over \\$50,000 or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tree is built, for a given combination of feature values, the tree can determine which bucket a new individual would fall in, and consequently whether that donor has a higher probability of making over \\$50,000 or whether they make at most \\$50,000."

    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
